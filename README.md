# Asset Stripper 
[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/immediatestyle/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

**Asset Stripper** removes unused assets (scripts/scenes/files/etc) from your Unity project. Finding and removing unused editor scripts or prefabs can increase the speed at which the Unity editor opens as well as removes clutter from your project.

## Features

* **Back up assets** that were stripped by generating a package
* **Scan** the project for unused game and editor scripts (including limited support for regular classes and structs)
* **Reference folders** which is useful for finding unused third party examples, prefabs, scenes, or scripts
* **Filter** by keyword on the results of a scan (match or exclude)

## Installation

- Add this GitHub URL to your package manager or, instead, in your 'manifest.json' add
```json
  "dependencies": {
	...

    	"com.moonlitstudios.assetstripper": "https://github.com/hopeforsenegal/com.moonlitstudios.assetstripper.git",

	...
  }
```

In Unity, launch the window by going to ```Moonlit->Asset Stripper->Prepare Stripping```
None of that working? **Honestly, just reach out us!** (Links & methods towards the bottom).


## How does it work?
The method is very brute force. It just scans all the files within a project that have visible meta files and builds an internal map. With the internal map we cross references to determine if they have a use in other files (using AssetDatabase.GetDependencies). 
It is very simple and straightforward.
